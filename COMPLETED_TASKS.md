Here is a comprehensive list of all the tasks completed in this session for the **TradeEd Global** website.

## 1. Website Content Updates

## 2. Admin Dashboard Enhancements

-   **Messages Tab**: Created a "Messages" page to view contact form inquiries.
-   **Navigation**: Added "Applicants" and "Messages" to the Admin Sidebar.
-   **Dashboard Home**:
    -   **Statistics**: Now shows real-time counts for Total Applications, Open/Closed Scholarships, and Messages.
    -   **Charts**: Implemented "Applications by Country" pie chart with **distinct brand colors** and flags for each country.
    -   **Recent Apps**: Displays the last 3 applications for quick access.

## 3. Application Process Improvements
-   **Streamlined Form**: Removed manual "Target Country" selection; it is now auto-filled from the Scholarship card.
-   **Document Uploads**:
    -   Converted text inputs to **File Uploads**.
    -   Restricted to **PROOOF OF ID ONLY** (Passport or ID).
    -   Removed heavy Resume/Transcript uploads to save space.
-   **Validation**: Enforced strict input types (PDF only for docs, numeric for GPA/Year).
-   **Admin Control**:
    -   Admins can **View** and **Download** uploaded ID documents.
    -   Admins can **Approve** or **Delete** applications.
    -   Admins can contact applicants directly via **WhatsApp** or **Email** buttons.

## 4. Scholarship Management
-   **Dynamic Status**: Scholarships now automatically show as "Open" 🟢 or "Closed" 🔴 based on their deadline.
-   **Date Picker**: Admins now use a calendar date picker to set deadlines comfortably.

## 5. Security & Polish
-   **Admin Login Link**: Removed the hidden "dot" link from the Navbar. Admin access is now restricted to manual URL entry (`/admin/login`).
-   **Back to Home**: Added a "Back to Home" link on the Admin Login page for better navigation.
-   **Bug Fixes**:
    -   Fixed `ReferenceError` crashes on the Dashboard.
    -   Fixed CSS `@import` ordering issues.
    -   Fixed Duplicate Key warnings in tables.

## 6. Visual Refinements
-   **Chart Colors**: The Country Pie Chart now uses specific, vibrant colors for each nation (e.g., USA=Blue, China=Red, Ireland=Green).
-   **Chart Legend**: The legend now displays Country Flags (🇺🇸, 🇨🇦, etc.) instead of percentages for a cleaner look.
